Fabelio Scraping is an app that scrapes product from fabelio.com and monitor the price changes. The app is built from Laravel 5.8. It has been deployed to Heroku at https://fabelio-scraper.herokuapp.com/

# New Features!

  - Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Fabelio Scraper uses a number of open source projects to work properly:


* [PHP](https://php.net) - The programming language used for the program
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com) - The framework used for the program
* [Guzzle](https://guzzlephp.org) - PHP package to scrape the HTML
* [D3.js](https://https://d3js.org/) - Great visualization tool
* [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io) - Markdown editor

### About Me

My name is Bramasto Wibisono, I'm from Tangerang, Indonesia. I graduated from university on February 2019. Even though I just started my career after graduation for a year, personally I feel like I already have a lot of knowledge about this industry and this position from my current company. Since December 2018, I've been working at a startup called Umroh.com as a Backend Developer. There I develop the backend system for the website and mobile applications. The system is developed with microservice infrastructure using Laravel and Lumen and deployed to AWS. I have fully knowledge to the techonologies used and good analytics and problem solving. 

So far my skills and projects are mostly developed with PHP especially Laravel and Lumen. But I don't think programming language is a boundary to what I can accomplish. I enjoy develop projects that challanges me to explore my knowledge and creativity, that way I won't find my job boring. Below is some of my personal projects that I have done.
