### About Me

My name is Bramasto Wibisono, I'm from Tangerang, Indonesia. I graduated from university on February 2019. Even though I just started my career after graduation for a year, personally I feel like I already have a lot of knowledge about this industry and this position from my current company. Since December 2018, I've been working at a startup called Umroh.com as a Backend Developer. There I develop the backend system for the website and mobile applications. The system is developed with microservice infrastructure using Laravel and Lumen and deployed to AWS. I have fully knowledge to the techonologies used and good analytics and problem solving. 

So far my skills and projects are mostly developed with PHP especially Laravel and Lumen. But I don't think programming language is a boundary to what I can accomplish. I enjoy develop projects that challanges me to explore my knowledge and creativity, that way I won't find my job boring. Below is some of my personal projects that I have done.
